              <p>Flaring and venting are oil and gas industry practices that allow companies to dispose of the natural gas they extract that is not used or sold. Carbon dioxide and methane, byproducts of flaring and venting, are both greenhouse gases. But methane has more than 80 times the environmental warming potential of carbon dioxide, which is why environmental scientists say cutting methane emissions is the quickest way to slow the rate of global warming.</p>

              <div class="new-header">
                <h5>What happens when companies flare?</h5>
              </div>

              <p>The oil and gas industry flares for operational, safety or economic reasons, or a combination of the three, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Natural gas is ignited in a flare stack which oxidizes methane into carbon dioxide and water. Depending on the efficiency of the flare, some amount of methane is also released. Operational flaring is often considered an unavoidable step in the oil and gas production process to release pressure buildup at wells, processing plants and storage facilities. Companies also flare during emergency situations. Some flares burn inefficiently and emit more substantial volumes of methane and other pollutants. State regulations set “flare efficiency” standards; the EPA recommends nothing below 95%. However, with limited on-the-ground inspections, it’s difficult to know if companies meet those requirements. Satellite technology can detect flares and determine their volumes based on heat signatures.</p>

                <h5>What happens when companies vent?</h5>
              </div>

              <p>Venting is the release of natural gas, primarily methane, directly into the atmosphere without combustion. As with flaring, venting can occur at multiple stages in the oil and gas production process for operational and safety reasons. As much as 20% of global methane emissions originate from the oil and gas sector, according to the International Energy Agency. In the United States, some states do not require companies to report the volume of gas they vent and gas they flare separately, thus obscuring the true environmental impact by not clarifying how much methane has been released. Five of the 13 top-flaring states — Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, North Dakota and Utah — ban venting outright, although all five offer exemptions that allow some venting. By directly releasing methane into the air, venting has a strong impact on climate change. Satellite technology cannot capture the volume of vented methane because there is no combustion that produces a measurable heat signature. Specialized infrared imaging technology is able to measure the invisible emissions that come from venting, but such technology is limited in scope.</p>

                <h5>What emissions do flaring and venting release?</h5>
              </div>

              <p>Emissions from flaring and venting are widely varied in content, but scientific studies have identified more than 60 pollutants, including harmful or toxic volatile organic compounds such as benzene, formaldehyde, propylene, toluene, xylene and hexane.</p>

                  <p>Flaring can also release several chemicals as a byproduct of combustion, such as nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Hydrogen sulfide, an extremely flammable and lethal gas, may also be present in flare emissions. Venting primarily releases unadulterated methane, but other harmful pollutants may also be present in large quantities, including hydrogen sulfide. In addition to the global warming impact of venting, releasing methane and other uncombusted pollutants into the environment contributes to smog at a local level, and health effects may include asthma and heart problems.</p>

                <h5>How would reducing U.S. flaring and venting combat climate change?</h5>
              </div>

              <p>According to the World Resources Institute, the U.S. accounts for roughly 13% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with 10% of those emissions being methane. The U.S. oil and gas industry was responsible for around 30% of those U.S. methane emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Even though Center for Climate and Energy Solutions reports that carbon dioxide emissions are higher in the U.S. than those of methane overall, climate scientists agree that reducing methane emissions would have a significant impact on slowing global warming. It has even been referred to as a “low-hanging fruit” in the fight against climate change by Christopher Elvidge, director of the Earth Observation Group at the Colorado School of Mines. In the short term, methane is more than 80 times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. Methane degrades over time, but it is significantly more harmful than carbon dioxide during its 12-year lifespan in the atmosphere. Methane emissions could be cut in half with already available technology, such as better methane sensors, leak detection devices, and mitigation units, and commitment to regulatory changes, according to Ilisa Ocko, a climate scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>

                <h5>How has flaring and venting been addressed at the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference?</h5>
              </div>

              <p>The top five countries that flared the most as of 2020 are Russia, Iraq, Iran, the United States and Algeria, according to the World Bank. It is, however, an easy step toward fighting climate change. During the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in early November, President Joe Biden unveiled his U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. This sweeping set of methane reduction initiatives backs up the Bureau of Land Management’s proposed rule requiring companies to pay royalties on flared or vented natural gas on federal and tribal lands and waters. However, it is mostly focused on other sources of methane emissions such as abandoned wells and pipelines. The EPA also proposed new rules, expected to be finalized and implemented near the end of 2021, limiting flaring and requiring the sale of or use of the extracted natural gas on the well site.  Companies would be allowed to flare gas only if they meet specific metering, monitoring and reporting standards set by the EPA. The Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are also working on more responsible management and reclamation of plugged onshore and offshore wells, ensuring that there will be fewer long-term leaks. The Global Methane Pledge, formally launched at the U.N. conference, establishes a commitment to reducing methane emissions from energy, agriculture and waste, including those from flaring and venting. The 110 countries that signed on have committed to “a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 and moving towards using best available inventory methodologies to quantify methane emissions, with a particular focus on high emission sources,” according to a September 2021 White House press release.</p>
